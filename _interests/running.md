I didn't pick up running until I made the decision that I was going to join the military, this was the year before I graduated from undergrad. Officers, especially Marine officers,
have a reputation for being good at running. While I was never a particularly gifted runner, I did decide that I didn't want to be bad at it. So while I am still not particularly good, I 
am at least smart in the way the train, recover, and approach running events and have gaslight myself enough to enjoy putting in the miles. 

Spartan Trail Half Marathon, Monterey, CA (Summer 2025)
======

This was my first non-physical fitness test event that I ran with a couple of friends from my Master's program and also Marines (SFMF). 
I was relatively new to these long trail events, the only previous experience I had was pacing Bobby (white shirt) at the end of his 50 miler back in Janurary. The third fellow (blue shirt) was
the ringleader of this, he was getting back into running after a medical procedure and wanted this to be the culminating event of his recovery. While not really in Monterey, the hills of Toro Park
out near Salinas, CA are beautiful and we got some amazing views in our 3 hour trudge. This route had some pretty steep downhills that taxed my quads and knees, but the good company made the time fly.
